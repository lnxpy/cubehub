The back side of CubeHub is a python script. Although python is one of the most powerful tools in networking, I used <a href="https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/"><b>requests</b></a> library to create connections and recieve JSON files and .XML data from webserver of <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/"><b>Github</b></a>.
