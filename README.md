### User-Interface
The User Interface of CubeHub has been made with <a href="https://bunifuframework.com/"><b>Bunifu</b></a> framework. FlatButton, GradientPanel, and FlatTextbox objects made this application beautiful and user-friendly.

### Backend
The back side of CubeHub is a python script. Although python is one of the most powerful tools in networking, I used <a href="https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/"><b>requests</b></a> library to make connections and receive JSON files and XML data from the web server of <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/"><b>Github</b></a>.
